We organized our first [workshop on metascience for machine learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2025/delft-ai/kick-off-workshop-metascience-for-machine-learning)  ! :sparkles:

This is an example post with image galleries.
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

Images can be made zoomable. Simply add data-zoomable to <img> tags that you want to make zoomable
