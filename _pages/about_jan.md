**Jan van Gemert:** I am the head of the Computer Vision lab at TU Delft, and my main research theme is finding & evaluating powerful yet flexible physical
priors for data-efficient visual recognition AI. I aim to do fundamental empirical understanding-based deep learning research, which is why I am interested in metascience for machine learning.

For me, ms4ml is about methodology. I'm not saying one methodology is 'better' than another,  and strongly believe in that machine learners should do research however they want. Since this includes myself, I have developed over the years an understanding-based style of empirical deep learning research. 

I find it important to write down, and share my style. Firstly, to communicate my expectations to students and collaborators, but also because writing them down forces me to reflect on them, where I learn and adapt my methodology according. Although I am not aiming to 'convert' people, as I do not think my way is 'better', I do believe that sharing my methodology allows others in the field to at least see that there are options in how to do machine learning research, and then still be completely free to do whatever they like with it (which is one of the reasons why I call my methodology 'guidelines' and not 'rules' :relaxed: ). 

I am not a strong believer in stating how things 'should be' done, and pointing out problems (complaining?) is not something that I find constructive. Instead, I aim to build, show, and do things to demonstratively make concrete steps towards the type of machine learning research I myself aim to do.

Some examples of some of my effort on machine learning methodology include:
- [Research organization](https://jvgemert.github.io/research.pdf), my guidelines on the organization of doing research, the mindset, processes, and the mentality.
- [Writing](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf) is a collection of common writing issues that I ran into. I find clear communication an inherent part of doing science. 
- [The storyline](https://jvgemert.github.io/storyline.pdf), is my main methodological tool for empirical, understanding-based, machine learning research.

I have set up public repositories for ms4ml, which include:
- [reproducedPapers.org](https://reproducedpapers.org/), a hub for reproduced deep learning papers and their reproductions.
- [ControlledExperimentsInMl.org/](https://controlledexperimentsinml.org/) for collecting, and sharing, controlled experiments for machine learning.

I am also teaching a MSc-level ms4ml course called [Fundamental Research in Machine and Deep Learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/dsait/msc-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-technology/programme/research-course).
